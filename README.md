# Streetscape Product Documentation

Streetscape is a managed service for land developers to easily administrate land projects during all stages of development and sales. The Streetscape API serves property data to our connector apps which provide live data-infused maps for our clients. The connector apps provide our integration partners with an easy-to-use layer on top of the Streetscape API.
